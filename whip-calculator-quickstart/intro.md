This is a simple tutorial for the features of Whip with a simple microservices application.

In particular, it will highlight:

1. Whip can be deployed on an application with no code changes (bottom of p2). Additionally, Whip can operate under partial deployment (i.e., only one of the services will have a Whip adapter).
2. Whip can detect first-order contract failures.
3. Whip can detect higher-order contract failures. Whip blames correctly (Section 5). Under partial deployment though, Whip uses the same blame label for all non Whip-enhanced services.
4. Whip leverages other adapters in enhanced communication to transmit blame labels for services.
5. Whip can detect indexed contract violations.

You will be able to do the tutorial interactively in your browser! Just follow the steps shown in the page.
