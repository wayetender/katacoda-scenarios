You've completed your first Whip interactive demo!

In particular, you saw that:

1. Whip can be deployed on an application with no code changes (bottom of p2). Additionally, Whip can operate under partial deployment (i.e., only one of the services will have a Whip adapter).
2. Whip can detect first-order contract failures.
3. Whip can detect higher-order contract failures. Whip blames correctly (Section 5). Under partial deployment though, Whip uses the same blame label for all non Whip-enhanced services.
4. Whip leverages other adapters in enhanced communication to transmit blame labels for services.
5. Whip can detect indexed contract violations.
